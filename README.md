# Learning Clojure with Advent of Code 2019 

See the previous repos:
* [AOC 2018 in Nim](https://github.com/nmyers217/advent_of_code_2018_nim)

I have been wanting to learn Clojure for a while now since I really love LISP,
and Clojure is the most viable LISP I have ever seen.

The best way for me to pick up a new language is to jump right in and solve some
problems,
and thankfully it is December 2019 and Advent of Code is putting out a ton of cool problems to solve this month.

The problems are on the [AOC website](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).

### Dependencies
 - Clojure is installed and in your path

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate into the src directory
3. Evaluate the file for a particular day in the clojure REPL (TODO: provide
   better instructions)
