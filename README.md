# Learning Clojure with Advent of Code 2019 

I have been wanting to learn Clojure for a while now since I really love LISP, and Clojure is the most viable LISP I have ever seen.

The best way for me to pick up a new language is to jump right in and solve some problems, and thankfully it is December 2019 and Advent of Code is putting out a ton of cool problems to solve this month.

The problems are on the [AOC website](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).

While many people approach AOC competitively and try to solve the problems for speed, my code is *attempting* to optimize for different goals:

- All the code is documented (this usually gets sloppier as the days drag on) and readable for educational purposes
- In an effort to learn as much about the language as possible, I may choose unnecessarily long, complex, imperformant, and/or unorthodox solutions (please forgive me)
- The code *attempts* to be idiomatic to the Clojure community's coding conventions (learning as I go)

Most of these goals are at the expense of speed.

### Dependencies
 - Clojure is installed and in your path

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate into the src directory
3. Evaluate the file for a particular day
